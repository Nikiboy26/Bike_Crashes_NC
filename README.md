# Bike Crashes in NC Data Science Project

**Project Brief**:
You have been working with the local government to help direct policy decisions. They are concerned about an increase in traffic accidents and think they may be able to make changes to reduce the severity of accidents that do occur. But they donâ€™t know what the most important features are for defining the difference between severity of an accident. They would like you to investigate the data and see if it would be possible to find the factors that are most important. Based on these factors, what changes should be made to reduce the severity of accidents that do occur?
